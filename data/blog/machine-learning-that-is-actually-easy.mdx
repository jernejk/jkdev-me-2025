Do you want to try machine learning, but don't want to invest too much time learning a new programming language or some other complicated API or complicated online tools?

Richard Campbell and I are geeking out about why you would want to look at machine learning, how to get started, and what should you know when building your prototype. 🧐

ML.NET Model Builder opens up the world of Machine Learning to all developers.

I had a blast doing the interview. I hope you'll enjoy watching it as much as I enjoyed making it! 😁

## Updated demo (screenshots)

Here are updated screenshots for ML .NET v1.4 Model Builder.

## Bonus

When using ML .NET Model Builder, it will try to determine if a column should be a hash table or text, which can have a significant impact on your use case. It decides based on the ration of unique and duplicate values and it might choose the wrong type because of that.

However, after generating the code, you can change from a hash table to text and vice versa.

1.  In file `ModelBuilder.cs` in method `BuildTrainingPipeline` change the `.Append` for desired column.

From:

```cs
.Append(mlContext.Transforms.Categorical.OneHotHashEncoding(new[] { new InputOutputColumnPair("Description", "Description") }))
```

To:

```cs
.Append(mlContext.Transforms.Text.FeaturizeText(inputColumnName: "Description", outputColumnName: "Description"))
```

![Update the Append from Categorical hash to Featurize text](/content/images/2019/12/ml-net-model-builder-10.png) **Figure: Update the Append from Categorical hash to Featurize text.**

2.  Retrain model by running `ModelBuilder.CreateModel();` in `Program.cs`. Return right after training because the model hasn't been copied yet to `bin` folder.

![Retrain model with feature text instead of categorical hash](/content/images/2019/12/ml-net-model-builder-11.png) **Figure: Retrain model with feature text instead of categorical hash.**

3.  Remove the code from step 2.

**NOTE:** If your project contains `.` in it's name, chances are that the path to the model will be incorrect. (a bug since v1.3) Make sure that path `MODEL_FILEPATH` in `ModelBuilder.cs` is correct!
