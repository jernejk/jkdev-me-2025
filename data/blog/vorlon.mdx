In this post we'll cover how to debug applications running in browser and/or devices that don't have debugging abilities. We'll manipulate DOM tree, see console output and more.

This post works great with remote debugging introduced in [Remote debugging on Android and iOS devices](/remote-debugging-on-devices/) blog post.

## Vorlon.JS

In short [Vorlon.JS](http://www.vorlonjs.io/) is an open source, extensible, platform-agnostic tool for remotely debugging and testing your JavaScript.

We can debug multiple browser locally or remotely on devices. All we need to do is run Voltron on a server and a `<script>` in the web application.

## Get started

First install Voltron with NPM:

```bash
npm i -g vorlon
```

And add in `index.html`:

```html
<script src="http://localhost:1337/vorlon.js"></script>
```

Run Vorlon in command line:

```bash
vorlon
```

Then go to `localhost:1337` to access the dashboard.

When accessing the website, we can see console logs, DOM tree and many more things.

Similarly as with Chrome/Edge/FireFox F12, we can highlight and modify DOM elements.

Let me know if you like me to write more about Vorlon and how to improve debugging on mobile devices.
