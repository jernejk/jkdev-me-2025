Recently I've been on a tour around Australia presenting about how .NET developers can start with their Machine Learning story in minutes.

I presented at the [SSW User Groups](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/NETUG) (Gold Coast, Brisbane, Melbourne, Canberra, and Sydney), [Melbourne ALT .NET User Group](https://www.meetup.com/Melbourne-ALT-NET/), [DDD Melbourne](https://www.dddmelbourne.com/) and soon at [DDD Sydney](https://www.dddsydney.com.au/) in just 2 short months. The response was amazing and it truly feels this talk made an impact on many people.

I'm working on making more demos with [ML.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/machinelearning-ai/ml-dotnet) with combination of Model Builder and AutoML while keeping it simple. I'm also working on an AI event with SSW, so stay tuned! :)

In the meantime, if you want to learn machine learning simplified for .NET devs, please watch this YouTube video. :)

**UPDATE:** With help of SSW and William, I'm doing [AI HackDay](https://aihackday.com/) in Melbourne, Brisbane and Sydney next year! (2020)  
  
**UPDATE 2:** Changed the video to be up-to-date. Original video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG1DHMNT0TA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG1DHMNT0TA)
